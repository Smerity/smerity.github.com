<h1>The First Honours Hurdle</h1>
<span class="post-date">18 July 2011</span>
<p>It has been just under three weeks since I began focusing on Honours.
Progress so far has been reasonably steady -- a burst of productivity followed by periods of debugging.
It seems that the parser kicks and bucks like a wild stallion at each of my modifications.</p>
<h2>Distractions</h2>
<p>Whilst all the exams, assessments and courses are out of the way, I still have many distractions.
I'm balancing on a knife's edge between happily exploring my recent new or renewed interests and losing focus on Honours.
Between the daily two hour train trip, catching up with friends, cooking, and general down time, I'm far less productive than I feel I need to be.
Whilst I may be making a bit more progress than other Honours students, that doesn't really justify it.</p>
<p>I have successfully played on the knife edge before, I just need to make sure I don't slip.</p>
<h2>Shift-Reduce Parsing</h2>
<p>The process of implementing the shift-reduce parsing algorithm in the C&amp;C framework was surprisingly simple, if you ignore all of the various bugs or inconsistencies that pop up.
Apart from a few sharp edges, the C&amp;C framework handled all of the complexities that arose from CCG (combinators, type-raising, lexical rules and so on), each of which would have taken me far longer to implement myself.
This also gives me the chance to use the C&amp;C chart parser as a reference implementation against the shift-reduce parser, which makes certain bugs far easier to diagnose (though not necessarily any faster to fix).
The code is by no means artistic, but it serves the purpose well enough.
There are a few areas that I'd like to go back and clean up from a purely aesthetic point of view, but code refactoring is likely premature and would serve little practical purpose.</p>
<p>What has bit me is some of the internal design intricacies of the parser.
Even though I've worked with the parser before, it's a far more complicated beast than you'd ever hope to imagine.
The documentation is lacking, but it's still significantly better than many other parsers and academic projects.
Given that, it's important to note that the documentation is well augmented by the people around the <a href="http://schwa.org/">lab</a>.
If you have a problem, chances are that someone has already encountered it and they're happy to help me out!</p>
<h2>Loopy Stack</h2>
<p>The most annoying problem I had was a "loopy stack" whilst implementing a core piece of the shift-reduce algorithm.
The naive shift-reduce algorithm is far less efficient than CKY chart parsing as it doesn't take any advantage of caching.
The graph-structured stack allows you to perform caching with the shift-reduce algorithm, and is in fact related to chart parsing in many ways.
Strangely, it hasn't been used much in practice, even though the speed advantages it offers are huge.
It was proposed in the early 90s and only recently has it resurfaced in the literature.</p>
<p>The initial implementation of the graph-structured stack was again surprisingly painless.
The C&amp;C parser already has to handle equivalence checking due to the way that chart parsing works, so for the most part it was a simple and subtle modification.
What wasn't so simple and subtle was the bug that popped up. Somehow I was getting a loop in my stack... This only happens to first year Data Structures students...</p>
<p><em>How the hell was I getting a loopy stack?</em></p>
<p>I spent a great deal of time checking my assumptions, modifying/refactoring my code, following pointers into the abyss and generally going mad.
Finally, after far too long, I came across the problem.
The C&amp;C chart parser does a bit of magic to help speed up parsing: it re-uses the chart.
That's perfectly fine and reasonable, but only if you're expecting it!
As the chart was being re-used, previous structures were accidentally finding themselves being actively used again.</p>
<p>You may ask why those objects still exists -- shouldn't they have been deleted to prevent memory leaks?
The C&amp;C parser does another trick that influences this however -- memory pools.
Memory pools allow incredibly fast allocation of objects.
De-allocation of these small objects is in fact far slower than just reclaiming the memory pool later on.
As such, none of the code does a traditional delete when the destructor is called, resulting in a far faster parser (with millions and millions of these small objects created a second) but a quite sinister bug!</p>
<p><em>Stupid loopy stacks causing me madness..!</em></p>
<p>With the loopy stacks delooped however, the shift-reduce algorithm took advantage of caching and hit similar speeds to that of the default chart algorithm.</p>
<h2>Current Evil</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, I go from bursts of productivity to periods of debugging.
This is the unhappy debugging period.
The parser works but testing over the development corpus for the WSJ shows a loss of 6% F-score against the reference implementation.
These bugs aren't easy to diagnose or fix, unfortunately, so I expect progress to be slow.</p>
<p><em>If I can fix this bug in six days, however, then I'll still be on target as far as my timeline is concerned!</em></p>
