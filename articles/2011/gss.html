<div id="post-content">
	
        <p>During my Honours thesis, I was performing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language parsing</a> (NLP).
NLP aims to allow computers to efficiently analyze, understand and even generate natural language.</p>
<p>My focus was on parsing language, or determining the structure of a sentence.
This is similar to parsing programming languages, something you're more likely familiar with, except that natural language is ambiguous.
The phrase "<em>I saw the girl on the hill with the telescope</em>" has many possible different derivations, for example.
A few example interpretations: the girl may be on the hill, the girl may be on the hill which has a telescope, the girl may have set up her telescope on the hill or you may have seen her with a telescope.</p>
<p>This ambiguity makes parsing a difficult task as there may be millions of different possible derivations.
Whilst there are ways to do this efficiently (with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm">CKY algorithm</a> being one of the most popular), I had to perform the parsing incrementally.
This led me to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom-up_parsing#Algorithm:_Shift-reduce_parsing">shift-reduce (SR) parsing</a>.
SR parsing is quite popular amongst programming language parsing as it's quite efficient for unambiguous languages.
For ambiguous languages, however, parsing takes worst-case exponential time.
With the addition of a relatively unexplored data structure, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph-structured_stack">Graph-Structured Stack</a> (GSS), this can be reduced down to worst-case polynomial time.</p>
<h2>Shift-Reduce Parsing</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">stack = [] # Start with the empty stack -- âˆ…
stack.append(&quot;A&quot;) # Shift
stack.append(&quot;B&quot;) # Shift
stack.append(&quot;C&quot;) # Shift
stack.append(&quot;D&quot;) # Shift
stack.append(&quot;E&quot;) # Shift
# stack = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;]</code></pre>

<h3>Deterministic Recogniser SR Parser</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">from collections import deque

sent = deque(list(&quot;ABCDEI&quot;))
stack = []
rules = [
  ((&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), &quot;F&quot;),
  ((&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), &quot;G&quot;),
  ((&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), &quot;H&quot;),

  ((&quot;F&quot;, &quot;I&quot;), &quot;J&quot;),
  ((&quot;G&quot;, &quot;I&quot;), &quot;J&quot;)
]

prev_stack = None
while sent or prev_stack != stack:
  # Print out the stack and store it for later comparison
  print &quot;Stack:&quot;, stack
  prev_stack = stack[:]
  # Try all reduction rules
  for rule, result in rules:
    if tuple(stack[-len(rule):]) == rule:
      print &quot;+ Reduce with %r =&gt; %r&quot; % (rule, result)
      [stack.pop() for x in rule]
      stack.append(result)
      continue
  # If there are tokens left in the input, shift
  if sent:
    stack.append(sent.popleft())
    print &quot;+ Shift on %s&quot; % stack[-1]</code></pre>


<h2>The Graph-Structured Stack</h2>
<p>The graph-structured stack is based around three key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splitting</li>
<li>Combining</li>
<li>Local Ambiguity Packing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Splitting</h3>
<p>The graph-structured stack makes the <em>reduce</em> operation non-destructive by creating a new head for each possible derivation.
Below we can see there are now four heads to the graph structured stack.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="/media/images/articles/2011/gss/splitting.png" />
</div>

<h3>Combining</h3>
<p>When a new node is <em>shifted</em>, it is combined with each of the heads of the graph-structured stack.
This means that only a single shift operation is needed instead of <strong>n</strong> shift operations where <strong>n</strong> is the number of possible derivations in the previous step.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="/media/images/articles/2011/gss/combining.png" />
</div>

<h3>Local Ambiguity Packing</h3>
<p>Finally, if two reduction rules produce the same node (for whatever we define "same" as), the two nodes are merged into a single node.
In the case below, two rules produce an equivalent node <strong>J</strong> (their stacks are equivalent as can be seen by the back pointer), so they are merged into a single <strong>J</strong> node.</p>
