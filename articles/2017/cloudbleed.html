  <p>A friend asked me to explain the <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139">Cloudflare Cloudbleed flaw</a> "in simple English for simple folk".<br />
This is my attempt.</p>
<!--Specifically: "How many steps from someone finding my data in this dump. To matching it to me. and then busting into my email account or Facebook or Amazon?"-->

<h2>What is (Charlie) Cloudflare?</h2>
<p>Cloudflare sits as a proxy in front of many websites.
Think of Cloudflare as <strong>Charlie Cloudflare</strong>, an assistant who prints documents for your entire office.
Hundreds of people at work use <strong>Charlie</strong> to print documents instead of doing it themselves.
Most of the time everything works out fine.
Occasionally however poor <strong>Charlie</strong> gets confused.
<!--- especially when we ask **Charlie** to modify the document before handing it back to us.--></p>
<h2>What mistake was Charlie making?</h2>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong> receives two requests at similar times - <strong>Alice</strong> asks <strong>Charlie</strong> to print her bank statement while <strong>Bob</strong> asks <strong>Charlie</strong> to print a short story.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong> accidentally prints <strong>Alice</strong>'s bank statement twice but hands her back a correct copy.
When <strong>Charlie</strong> goes to print <strong>Bob</strong>'s short story, <strong>Charlie</strong> grabs a random page or two from <strong>Alice</strong>'s bank statement by accident and ends up inserting it into <strong>Bob</strong>'s stack of pages.</p>
<p>Most of the time no-one will notice what went wrong, only seeing a brief spurt of gibberish at the end of their document and dismissing it.</p>
<h2>Enter Gary Google, the librarian</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, there are a few people who use the assistant continuously - specifically <strong>Gary Google</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong> prints thousands of pages a day and stores them in a little personal library that anyone can look at and copy from.
Given <strong>Gary</strong> prints so much, it's likely that <strong>Gary</strong> end up with many random pages, such as a page from <strong>Alice</strong>'s bank statements or the end of <strong>Bob</strong>'s short story.</p>
<p>Eventually <strong>Gary</strong> grabs a document from his library and realizes <strong>Charlie</strong> made a mistake.
<strong>Gary</strong> looks at a single shelf from his enormous library and finds similar mistakes a number of times.</p>
<p>There's an awful lot of bank statements in this section labelled "Romance" ...</p>
<h2>Stop it Charlie!</h2>
<p><strong>Gary</strong> informs <strong>Charlie</strong> of his error.
<strong>Charlie</strong> freaks out and tries to fix it.
<strong>Charlie</strong> stops accidentally inserting pages into other people's documents, tells everyone to discard any documents that have strange pages in them, and then claims the situation is solved.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't fix the issue - <strong>Gary</strong>'s library might have random snippets of anyone's data in there!
Not only is this true for <strong>Gary</strong>, it's also true for anyone else who grabbed print outs from <strong>Charlie</strong> at the time, including <strong>Alice</strong>, <strong>Bob</strong>, or <strong>Gary</strong>.</p>
<p>Worst of all, if malicious <strong>Mallory</strong> realized <strong>Charlie</strong>'s mistakes, she might have printed thousands of pages on purpose, searching through the contents she retrieved for these accidental leaks.
Many of them will likely be innocent enough - maybe a page from <strong>Bob</strong>'s short story - but some many contain the combination to <strong>Alice</strong>'s bank vault.</p>
<h2>The unfortunate summary ...</h2>
<p>We don't know what was leaked, where it was leaked to, or whether the people who received them have stored the copy.
We only know that any of the documents printed by <strong>Charlie</strong> might have been leaked.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Google</strong> is trying to clean his vast library but is still having a real hard time given there are so many files.
Occasionally it's not even obvious if a random page was slipped into a document - <strong>Bob</strong>'s short stories can get very strange!</p>
<p><strong>Bill Bing</strong>, <strong>Duck DuckGo</strong>, <strong>Malicious Mallory</strong>, <strong>Ian InternetArchive</strong>, and <strong>Chloe CommonCrawl</strong> might also still have random pages without having deleted them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this likely to directly leak your password? Not likely - but we don't know.</li>
<li>Is this likely to impact a service you use? Maybe - but again we don't know.</li>
<li>Does this impact anyone not using Cloudflare? No.</li>
<li>Does this mean any page you've loaded from Cloudflare might have been leaked? Maybe.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's really not much we can do to know what was leaked unfortunately - or who it was leaked to.</p>
<p>That's potentially the worst part ...</p>

  You reached the bottom! Reading can be challenging, so I think you deserve a reward. I'd offer you <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Cake">cake</a>, but after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">a certain robot-human conflict</a> started due to cake it may not be a wise choice. So here:
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/media/images/mini_coin.png" height="32" width="32" />
  </div>
  Take a coin. No, not a Bitcoin. Do you know how <a title="When I originally put this note here, Bitcoins were only a few dollars each...">expensive</a> those are? ಠ_ಠ
