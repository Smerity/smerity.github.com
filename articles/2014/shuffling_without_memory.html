<h1 class="post-title">The Saga Of: Shuffling without using memory</h1>
<h3 class="post-date">September 24, 2014</h3>
  <p>tl;dr:
You have an enormous compressed file, <code>urls.gz</code>, that you want to shuffle into <code>urls_shuffled.gz</code>.
First attempt is to run <code>zcat urls.gz | shuf | gzip &gt; urls_shuffled.gz</code>.
Infuriatingly, <code>shuf</code> only works in memory.
<code>sort</code> is beautiful in that it works just as well for enormous files as it does for small.</p>
<p><em>Note: I'm solving this problem in real time, so it's not 100% accurate but shows the thought process.
Feel free to tease me when I get it wrong... ;)</em></p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to take advantage of <code>sort</code>'s ability to handle large files relatively easily.
One could preface each line with a random number, generated using any appropriate program such as <code>awk</code>, but that seems inefficient.
Luckily, on checking <code>man sort</code>, there is a <code>--random-sort</code> option that "sort[s] by random hash of keys".
Brilliant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>sort</code> still needs the file to be on disk, so it needs to be decompressed.
Luckily <code>sort</code> will handle the heavy lifting there, and is really intelligent with large files, but it could potentially be an issue if the decompressed output is really quite large.
The closest solution about the place for this is a question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18125079/sort-lots-of-large-compressed-files">sorting lots of large compressed files</a> and even that mainly focuses on parallelizing the <code>sort</code> process.
It does however make a nifty use of the <code>--merge</code> flag that only merges by assuming the input is sorted.
Even then, I'd be curious to know whether <code>sort</code>'s own <code>--parallel=N</code> flag results in higher efficiency than the solution suggested.</p>
<p>The file I want to shuffle (<code>com.txt.xz</code>, a list of 61 million .com domains from <a href="dnscensus2013.neocities.org">DNS Census 2013</a>) is only 187 megabytes compressed, so it shouldn't be too problematic to use a less than perfect method.</p>
<p>Boom, let's do this thing.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">xzcat</span> <span class="n">com</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">txt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">xz</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">pv</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">sort</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sort</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">gzip</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">media</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ephemeral0</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">torrent</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">com_random</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">gz</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>xzcat</code> decompresses the file, <code>pv</code> allows me to see how much data is flowing through the pipe, <code>sort</code> handles randomly shuffling, and <code>gzip</code> compresses the final output.
If you're curious and you want to monitor what's happening, <code>pv</code> is a start, but we can also check <code>htop</code> (shinier than <code>top</code>) for memory and CPU usage and <code>iotop</code> for disk usage.</p>
<p>On reviewing using <code>htop</code>, my eight core box is only using one core -- almost all <code>sort</code> and a tiny bit <code>xzcat</code>.
In the words of <strong>The Social Network</strong>, "it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl script".
Except in this case the command line and sort flags.</p>
<p>Nope, the <code>--parallel=8</code> flag does nothing.
Huzzah.
Also tested without <code>--random-sort</code> and it still doesn't work.
Whilst in the manpage again I came across <code>--compress-program=...</code> -- you can compress the temporary output of <code>sort</code>.
Useful to know for later but it will likely end up slowing down the process here.</p>
<p>Turns out that <code>--random-sort</code> is really quite slow.
Like, stunningly slow, with full CPU utilization for one core, processing maybe a megabyte per second.
Blargh.
This is especially annoying for me as I don't want perfectly random, I just want pseudo-random, and would be happy with large imperfections.
I'm curious whether this performance issue is due to the hashing algorithm used by <code>sort</code> or possibly due to sorting entirely random keys being a complete pain.
Could be either.
It certainly doesn't help that each new key is sorted according to a hash, and the hash aims to evenly distribute values across the entire range.</p>
<p>Losing patience and sanity, especially as I don't want a truly random sort.
I pondered randomly sorting sequential partitions (i.e. split the file in 10, randomly sort those 10 files), and then merge them using <code>sort</code>, but then the issue with that is it could end up very skewed on a theoretical basis.
Imagine if the first segment end up with the first guy getting the largest number.
That segment would not be merged until the end, in which case the entire segment would be lumped on.
The only "random" part would be within the segment -- a very limited amount of random.
Ewww.</p>
<p>Now I'm curious how large the file actually is.
Maybe I should give up on being smart and just expand it to disk.
Disk is cheap and I happen to have a good chunk of it.
<code>time xzcat com.txt.xz | pv | wc -c</code> will give me the size in bytes, plus <code>pv</code> to make sure I don't get bored.
<code>pv</code> reports it's reading at around 30MB/s and half a minute later, <code>wc</code> reports the final file is around 1.1 GB (1112068488 bytes).</p>
<p>Damn.
I thought it was bigger.
In my defence, my day job is spent dealing with things that don't sanely fit on hard disks.
Let's expand the file and then try <code>sort --random-sort</code> on that.
Bam, now <code>sort</code> is using all cores and, surprise surprise, the file is actually entirely cached in memory, so no disk activity.
I should also mention, <code>sort</code> will use up to eight cores by default without you specifying the <code>--parallel</code> flag, so no work needed.</p>
<p>It has now been running for some time, and <code>iotop</code> reports that <code>sort</code> is actually using disk.
Spurts of a few megabytes per second at a time.
In <code>/tmp/</code> there are a few random <code>sort...</code> files such as <code>sortO17hPL</code> are all around 200MB in size.
Upon checking out the contents with <code>head</code>, one can see a pretty interesting pattern emerging.</p>

<p>Each file has a random chunk, yes, but only within a restricted domain of the alphabet.
The original file, <code>com.txt.xz</code>, was sorted alphabetically.
This is exactly what you'd expect from merge sort -- sort chunk by chunk and then merge those chunks.
The only weirdness here of course is that we're sorting by random.</p>
<p>I want to try and find you a later temporary sort file, one which actually involves combining two or more of these together.
For that we can use <code>ls -ltr</code>.
Honestly, I don't even remember what the flags stand for, it's instinctive when I want it sorted by creation with some details.
Turns out <code>-l</code> is for long listing format, <code>-r</code> is for reverse, and <code>-t</code> is for sorting by modification time (newest to oldest).
Makes sense.
Thanks past me for figuring that out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for those viewing at home, CPU usage has dropped but one process has spiked -- <code>gzip</code>.
It's now receiving data to compress from <code>sort</code>.
This means <code>sort</code> is no longer using temporary files, it's merging for the six files for the final result.
I do believe I could explicitly make <code>sort</code> do more loops, but honestly, I leave that as an experiment for the reader at home, as I'm (a) lazy + (b) 3:30am + (c) I actually want to use this for an interesting task.
Now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't have gzipped it, but oh well, live and learn, too late to bother restarting the command now and <code>gzip</code> is certainly not going to be a bottleneck at either end.</p>
<p>And I'm done!
16 minutes in real time, 60 minutes in user time.
User time is the time the CPU spent spinning in user mode on our task.
If it was breaking the laws of physics, I'd be very angry, but it's allowed to go faster than reality as it's counting the time spent on each of the eight cores.</p>
